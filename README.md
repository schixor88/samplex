# samplex - github actions
a sample kotlin android app, just to get hands-on some stuffs related to github actions

## what's here
- ci_deploy.py file contains access-token for dropbox where you can push your build apk
- change the access-token with your own dropbox access-token to get started
- inside .github/workflows/ we have github action files
- all the proccess which we ask github to perfom like gradle build, assemble apk etc is done by the yml file
